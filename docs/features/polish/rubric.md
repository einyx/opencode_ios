# Polish Rubric

The machine-checkable form of the **Quiet Tech** spec. One row per checkable condition.
This is the *definition of done* for the "superpolished app experience" initiative — a
PR cannot be reviewed against taste, only against these rows.

> **Status:** draft v1 — awaiting a rubric owner (see [Open Questions](plan.md#open-questions-for-the-team)).
> **Authority:** the `QT-*` clause IDs live in [`docs/design.md`](../../design.md).
> **Measured baseline:** [`audit.md`](audit.md) records where the app stands against
> each row today.
> **Plan:** [`plan.md`](plan.md).

## How to read a row

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **ID** | Stable identifier. Never renumbered; retired rows are kept with their final state so the audit history stays readable. |
| **Rule** | What must be true, stated so that it can be true or false. |
| **Source** | `QT-*` = a clause in `docs/design.md` · `REPO` = a repo constraint (`AGENTS.md` / `PROJECT-CONTEXT.md`) · `INIT` = introduced by this initiative (`plan.md`) |
| **Check** | The machine-checkable predicate. Where a check is a grep, the exact pattern is given. |
| **Enforcement** | `lint` → a rule in `scripts/polish_lint.sh` · `test` → an assertion in XCTest · `screenshot` → a fixture screenshot reviewed against a *textual* description (PNGs are never committed, `docs/tests.md:216`) · `review` → human code review · `manual` → on-device check |
| **Scope** | `all` · a screen name · `ios-only` · `android-shared` (the sibling Android client must match) · `deferred` |

`ios-only` and `android-shared` are the parity split required by
`docs/design.md` §QT-PRINCIPLE §7 and §QT-PALETTE (session-indicator optical sizes).
A rubric row with no parity tag is treated as `ios-only` for the shared-core surfaces
until the Android client is checked.

| POL-COLOR-06 | `accent.muted` is the accent at 8% alpha | `QT-PALETTE` | opacity token == 0.08 | test | all |

| POL-COLOR-19 | No raw spacing literal in a View — spacing comes from `DesignSpacing` | `QT-LANDING` | `grep -rEn "\.(padding\|spacing)\([^)]*[0-9]" Views --include="*.swift" \| grep -v DesignSpacing` → 0 | lint | all |

## Typography

| ID | Rule | Source | Check | Enforcement | Scope |

| POL-MOTION-06 | The thinking row toggles without an animation — it grows in place | `QT-MOTION` | the thinking card's tap handler toggles `expanded` with no `withAnimation`; the tool row's expansion is governed by POL-MOTION-02 | review | chat |

| POL-MOTION-10 | Non-essential motion respects `accessibilityReduceMotion` | `QT-PRINCIPLE` §6 | each motion site reads the reduce-motion flag or is allowlisted | review, lint | all |

## Haptics

> These rows were introduced by this initiative. `docs/design.md` §QT-HAPTIC was added
> in Phase 4 to carry the sensory layer the original spec did not cover; the rows below
> cite it.

| ID | Rule | Source | Check | Enforcement | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| POL-HAPTIC-01 | Sending a message produces a haptic | `QT-HAPTIC` | a `DesignHaptics.fire(.messageSent)` site exists | review, lint (Phase 1) | composer, ios-only |
| POL-HAPTIC-02 | A permission request arriving produces a distinct haptic | `QT-HAPTIC` | site exists; its signature differs from every other event | review, lint (Phase 1) | chat, ios-only |
| POL-HAPTIC-03 | A question arriving produces a distinct haptic | `QT-HAPTIC` | site exists; its signature differs from every other event | review, lint (Phase 1) | chat, ios-only |
| POL-HAPTIC-04 | A failed send produces a distinct haptic | `QT-HAPTIC` | site exists; its signature differs from every other event | review, lint (Phase 1) | composer, ios-only |

| POL-HAPTIC-08 | No haptic fires while the microphone is open | `QT-HAPTIC` | `isAllowed(reduceMotion:microphoneOpen:)` suppresses **every** event when the microphone is open — no blanket exemption; **every** call site passes the shared `state.isMicrophoneCaptureActive` (the flag is mandatory — there is no default) | test | all, ios-only |
| POL-HAPTIC-09 | Silent mode and Reduce Motion have an explicit, documented policy | `QT-HAPTIC` | the **Reduce Motion** half is asserted in `DesignHapticsTests` (`.reduceMotionKeepsAlertingEventsAndDropsConfirmingOnes`); the **silent-mode** half is a written policy, not a platform guarantee, so it is enforced by review and canaried by `DesignHapticsTests` | test, review | all, ios-only |

## States: empty, loading, error

| ID | Rule | Source | Check | Enforcement | Scope |

| POL-A11Y-06 | Layout survives `zh-Hans` and long-locale strings | `REPO` | per-screen acceptance list; no fixed width clips a label | manual | all |
| POL-A11Y-07 | No fixed width may clip a localised label | `INIT` | `SessionListView.swift:29` fixed `width: 88` is replaced | review, test | sessions |

## Per-surface acceptance criteria

Each surface is checked against the rubric rows that apply to it, plus the three
cross-cutting checks below, which apply everywhere.

**Cross-cutting, every surface**

1. Light and dark mode both reviewed.
2. Dynamic Type at `accessibility3` reviewed.
3. `zh-Hans` reviewed, including long-locale overflow.

| Surface | Rubric families that apply | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Chat message stream | POL-MESSAGE-01…07, POL-CARD-01…12, POL-TYPE-11…12, POL-MOTION-01…06, POL-COMPOSER-10, POL-STATE-03, POL-ERROR-01…04 | The first vertical slice (Phase 5). Excludes the composer and voice rail. |
| Composer | POL-COMPOSER-01…10, POL-MOTION-01, POL-HAPTIC-01, POL-HAPTIC-04, POL-HAPTIC-07…09 | Sequenced **last** (Phase 7) — PRs #215/#216 await on-device acceptance. |
| Session list | POL-COLOR-13, POL-COLOR-16, POL-MESSAGE-06, POL-STATE-01…02, POL-STATE-06…07, POL-A11Y-02…04, POL-A11Y-07, POL-TYPE-02 | Blocked until the host-profile diff merged — **now merged** (`fe3ec83`). |
| Settings | POL-COLOR-13, POL-TYPE-01…06, POL-MOTION-10 | The "does the grammar generalise?" surface. Also exercises `design.md:238` (Dynamic Type on `LabeledContent`). |
| Host profiles | POL-COLOR-08, POL-ERROR-02…04, POL-A11Y-05…07, POL-STATE-04…05 | Also `design.md:242` (no raw Swift error). Requires the privacy review. |
| Files | POL-CARD-01…02, POL-TYPE-06, POL-STATE-04 | File preview is plain text with line numbers, no syntax highlighting (`QT-BOUNDARY`). |
| Car / Ambient | POL-COLOR-08, POL-TYPE-01, POL-MOTION-07…10, POL-HAPTIC-07…09 | Experimental surface; the mic level meter is exempt from the motion budget. |
| Preview / web | POL-TYPE-06, POL-STATE-04 | Markdown preview and image zoom. |
| Watch | POL-TYPE-01…06, POL-COLOR-08 | **`deferred`** — out of v1 by decision; `WatchAmbientApp.swift` has zero token usage and uses raw `.font(.caption)` / `.font(.system(size: 42))` / `.foregroundStyle(.orange)`. Gets a `DEFERRED` row, not silent coverage. |
